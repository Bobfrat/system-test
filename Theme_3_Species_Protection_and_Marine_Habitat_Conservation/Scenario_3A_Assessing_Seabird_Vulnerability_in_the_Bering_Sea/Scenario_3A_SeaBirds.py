# # IOOS System Test - Theme 3 - Scenario A - [Description](https://github.com/ioos/system-test/wiki/Development-of-Test-Themes#scenario-3a-assessing-seabird-vulnerability-in-the-bering-sea)
# 
# ## Assessing Seabird Vulnerability in the Bering Sea
# 
# ## Questions
# 1. Can all the PMEL models and their corresponding variables be adequately discovered and accessed using IOOS tools?
# 2. Can we discover, access, and overlay Important Bird Area polygons (and therefore other similar layers for additional important resource areas) on PMEL climate projections for the Bering Sea?
# 3. Is metadata for projected climate data layers and Important Bird Area polygons sufficient to determine a subset of polygons desired by a query?
# 4. Can a simple set statistics (e.g., mean and standard deviation) be derived from multiple variables in each of the six models to derive the forecast variability of climate conditions through time, through the end of the model runs (2003-2040)?
# 5. Can we create a standardized matrix or other display method for output variables that allow resource experts to easily assess projected changes in climate variables, within given ranges of time, and compare projected changes across multiple coupled oceanographic and climate models?
# 6. Can we develop a set of process-specific guidelines and a standardized set of outputs for a tool that would allow researchers to address a diversity of resource management questions relative to projected changes in climate for specific zones of interest?
